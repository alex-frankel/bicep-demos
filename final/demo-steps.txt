PRIOR TO DEMO:
 - delete demo rg completely
 - ensure you have "nightly" CLI in expected path for Az CLI

DEMO STEPS: 
 - quickly do the basics
  * create a app plan, show off intellisense, params, outputs w/ resource completions
 - do regular bicep build to show what that looks like
 - show how app plan can be consumed as a module
 - preview with what-if WITHOUT transpiling to JSON
 - decompile a *slightly* more complex sample to show how easy it is to migrate
  * consume that as a module as well
 - add conditionals and deploy
 - turkey out of oven to show two different types of nginx frontends
